            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Claire &#128075;</p>
            <p>I'm a Software Engineer working in the Site Reliability Engineering team at Pexip.
                I'm passionate about building reliable and well-instrumented systems which follow best practices.
                Well-documented code and systems is a must for me!</p>
            <p>My background started with environmental sustainability so I am currently combining my expertise and
                passion
                by contributing to the
                "CNCF Technical Advisory Group for Environmental Sustainability" as a lead!</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Isn't this a bit basic?</h2>
            <p><strong>Yes, it is!</strong> I am a firm believer in continuous learning and front-end web development is
                one
                area of software that I don't have much experience with.
                I am currently completing the codefirstgirls <a
                    href="https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/coding-kickstarter">Introduction
                    to Web Development</a> course learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and combining this with JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                One benefit of this simplicity is the reduced carbon impact!
