        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Claire &#128075;</p>
        <p>I'm a Software Engineer working in the Site Reliability Engineering team at Pexip.
            I'm passionate about building reliable and well-instrumented systems which follow best practices.
            Well-documented code and systems is a must for me!</p>
        <p>My background started with environmental sustainability so I am currently combining my expertise and passion
            by contributing to the
            "CNCF Technical Advisory Group for Environmental Sustainability" as a lead!</p>

        <h2>Isn't this a bit basic?</h2>
        <p><strong>Yes, it is!</strong> I am a firm believer in continuous learning and front-end web development is one
            area of software that I don't have much experience with.
            I am currently completing the codefirstgirls <a href="https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/coding-kickstarter">Introduction
                to Web Development</a> course learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
